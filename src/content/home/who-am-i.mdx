## Who am I?

My name's [Ascor](https://github.com/Ascor8522). I am a native French speaker from <Note title={NoteAboutBelgium}>Belgium</Note>.

I have been helping people learn French in their free time for over <YearsTeaching /> years now, most of them having English as their native language.

This has allowed me to learn about the common pitfall encountered by those learners, the topics they were struggling the most with, some of the false idea they had about French, and some tips and tricks to help them learn better (understand "smarter") and faster.

Besides French, I also speak other languages fluently, like English and Dutch. I can also understand German and Spanish to some extend.
Being multi-lingual lead me to develop a better understanding of how languages work, and how to learn them.
