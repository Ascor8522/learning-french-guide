# Ascor's Guide at Learning French

This repo contains a guide reassembling tips and tricks I've learned while teaching people French over the internet.
It is not meant to be a complete guide, but rather a collection of advices and resources that I've found useful.

## Under the hood

This guide is written in MDX and uses Vite to render the main document.

MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to write JSX inside Markdown files.

The site is deployed on Vercel.

### How to run the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ascor8522/learning-french-guide.git
npm install
npm run dev
```
